      <h2>Origin Story</h2>
      <img src="./assets/images/about.jpg" alt="begining stage of restaurant">
      <p>It all started in the busy streets of New York, Mr. and Mrs. Suwan wanted to start a legacy with a family owned restaurant due to Mrs. Suwan being pregnant with their first child. At first it was a bit difficult to start selling due to being too new, so they began to have a promotion to draw in customers, they served a free serving of Moo Satay for every new customer that came in. It was a success! Their vast menu of flavors meant that all the customers can taste the culture from Thailand. After a decade of constant business they decided to expand and move to California to get more traffic since it is known as a tourist state. </p>
